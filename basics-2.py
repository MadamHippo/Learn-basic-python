LIST INDICES

Python list elements are ordered by index, a number referring to their placement in the list. List indices start at 0 and increment by one.

~ remove() delete the matching element/object whereas del and pop removes the element at a specific index.
~ del and pop deals with the index. The only difference between the two is that- pop return deleted the value from the list and del does not return anything.
~ Pop is the only way that returns the object.
~ Remove is the only one that searches objects (not index).

~ If you want to delete a specific object in the list, use remove method.
~ If you want to delete the object at a specific location (index) in the list, you can either use del or pop.
~ Use the pop, if you want to delete and get the object at the specific location

Which list would be created by running this code?

list(range(2, 14, 4))
2 = where you start.
14 = where you should stop before.
4 = how much you actually need to skip between.
[2 , 6, 10 is the answer]
